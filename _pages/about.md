<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Fangzhi Xu (徐方植), a second-year master student in Xi'an Jiaotong University, major in Computer Science, advised by [Prof. Jun Liu](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/liukeen/4). In 2021, I received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Xi’an Jiaotong University.

My research interests include (but not limited to) natural language processing, question answering and logical reasoning.

I have published researches in some top-tier conferences and journals, such as SIGIR and TKDE. Also, I was awarded National Scholarship (3 times) and won a lot of international competition prizes. Also, I serve as a PC member (or reviewer) for SIGIR 2023 and IEEE TNNLS.

I am actively looking for Research Intern opportunities currently!
